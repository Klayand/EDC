## What To Do?

### Implementation

- [x] Replace the Gaussian noise initialization with the background (RDED).
- [x] Add sharpness of CWA for backbone-based generalized matching.
- [ ] Add closeness of CWA for backbone-based generalized matching.
- [ ] Conduct experiments across CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet and ImageNet-1k.
- [ ] Conduct experiments across ImageNet-100, ImageNette and ImageWoof.
- [x] Add some new backbones, such as AlexNet, MobileViT, DeiT, DenseNet, RegNet, ResNext.

### Research

- [x] Inspired from sharpness of CWA to derive the theory of CS-DC.
- [ ] Inspired from closeness of CWA to derive the theory of CS-DC.
- [x] Why RDED initialization is effective (theoretical derivation)?
- [x] Why generalized matching can work (theoretical derivation)?
- [ ] The better hyperparameter setting (ablation study).
