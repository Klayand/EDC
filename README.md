# CS-DC

Offical Implementation of our research:

## What To Do?

### Implementation

- [ ] Replace the Gaussian noise initialization with the background (RDED).
- [ ] Add CWA for backbone-based generalized matching.
- [ ] Conduct experiments across CIFAR-10/100, Tiny-ImageNet, ImageNet-1k and ImageNet-21k.
- [ ] Add some new backbones, such as AlexNet, MobileViT, DeiT, DenseNet, RegNet, ResNext.

### Research

- [ ] Inspired from CWA to derive the theory of CS-DC.
- [ ] Discussion which backbone is most critical in CS-DC, maybe throwing out some interesting inspiration.
- [ ] Write our paper.
